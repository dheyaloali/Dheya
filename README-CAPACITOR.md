# Employee Management System - Capacitor Implementation

This document outlines the steps taken to convert the employee side of the application into a native mobile app using Capacitor.

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Removed PWA Implementation**
   - Removed PWA configuration from `next.config.mjs`
   - Deleted PWA-related files (`manifest.json`, service workers)
   - Removed PWA-related components and hooks
   - Updated layouts to remove PWA wrappers

2. **Set Up Capacitor**
   - Installed Capacitor core and CLI
   - Created Capacitor configuration (`capacitor.config.ts`)
   - Added Capacitor plugins for native functionality:
     - Geolocation
     - Push Notifications
     - Camera
     - Preferences (storage)
     - Network
     - App lifecycle

3. **Created Utility Hook**
   - Implemented `useCapacitorFeatures` hook for accessing native functionality
   - Added fallbacks for web environment

4. **Created Example Component**
   - Implemented `LocationTracker` component using Capacitor geolocation
   - Added offline/online sync capabilities
   - Implemented battery level monitoring

5. **Added Android Platform**
   - Successfully added Android platform to the project
   - Synced web assets with the Android project

## Next Steps

1. **Install Development Tools**
   - Install Android Studio for Android development
   - Install Xcode for iOS development (Mac only)

2. **Fix Next.js Build Issues**
   - Address dynamic route issues for static export
   - Fix API route issues for static export
   - Update authentication implementation for static export

3. **Complete Capacitor Integration**
   - Integrate Capacitor hooks into existing employee components
   - Update location tracking to use Capacitor geolocation
   - Implement offline storage for attendance and sales data
   - Add push notification handling

4. **Test and Deploy**
   - Test on Android emulator and physical devices
   - Test on iOS simulator and physical devices (Mac only)
   - Generate signed APK/AAB for Android
   - Generate IPA for iOS (Mac only)

## Usage Instructions

### Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Run the web version:
   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. Build for Capacitor:
   ```
   pnpm run build:capacitor
   ```

4. Open Android project:
   ```
   pnpm run open:android
   ```

5. Open iOS project (Mac only):
   ```
   pnpm run open:ios
   ```

### Adding New Native Functionality

1. Install the Capacitor plugin:
   ```
   pnpm add -w @capacitor/plugin-name
   ```

2. Sync the native projects:
   ```
   npx cap sync
   ```

3. Update the `useCapacitorFeatures` hook to include the new functionality.

4. Use the hook in your components.
