# Employee Status Migration Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration to use `user.status` as the single source of truth for employee status in the Employee Management System. The changes ensure consistency, reduce redundancy, and simplify status management across the backend and frontend.

---

## 1. Schema Changes
- **Removed**: `status` field from the `Employee` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Kept**: `status` field in the `User` model (values: `active`, `inactive`).
- **Migration**: Ran a Prisma migration to drop the `status` column from the `Employee` table.
- **Prisma Client**: Regenerated to reflect the schema changes.

---

## 2. API Changes
- **All status logic now uses `user.status`**:
  - **PATCH `/api/employees/[id]/status`**: Updates the `status` field on the `User` model, not `Employee`.
  - **PATCH `/api/employees/[id]`**: Updates `user.status` if provided in the request body.
  - **POST `/api/employees`**: Sets the status only on the `User` record when creating a new employee.
- **Bug Fix**: Updated API route handlers to `await context.params` before accessing route parameters, per Next.js app directory requirements.

---

## 3. UI Changes
- **All status references in the UI now use `employee.user?.status`**:
  - Filtering, displaying, and toggling status in `employee-table.tsx` and related components.
  - Edit and details dialogs reference and update `user.status`.
- **No more references to `employee.status` in the codebase.**

---

## 4. Practical Notes
- **Status values are always lowercased in the database (`active`, `inactive`).**
- **Toggling status in the UI updates the `User` record and reflects immediately.**
- **API responses and UI now consistently show the correct status.**
- **No more console errors about `params` in API routes.**

---

## 5. Why This Was Done
- **Single source of truth**: Prevents data inconsistency and bugs.
- **Cleaner code**: No need to sync status between two tables.
- **Easier maintenance**: All status logic is in one place.

---

## 6. Next Steps
- Continue to use `user.status` for all employee status logic.
- If you add new features, always reference and update status on the `User` model.
